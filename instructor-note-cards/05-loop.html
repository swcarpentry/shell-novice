# 5. Loops

---

# Introduction

**Loops** are key to productivity improvements through automation as they allow us to execute
commands repetitively. 
Suppose we have several hundred genome data files named `basilisk.dat`, `unicorn.dat`, and so on.
In this example,
we'll use the `creatures` directory which only has two example files,
but the principles can be applied to many many more files at once.
We would like to modify these files, but also save a version of the original files, naming the copies
`original-basilisk.dat` and `original-unicorn.dat`.
We can't use:

~~~
$ cp *.dat original-*.dat
~~~


because that would expand to:

~~~
$ cp basilisk.dat unicorn.dat original-*.dat
~~~


This wouldn't back up our files, instead we get an error:

~~~
cp: target `original-*.dat' is not a directory
~~~

This problem arises when `cp` receives more than two inputs. When this happens, it
expects the last input to be a directory where it can copy all the files it was passed.
Since there is no directory named `original-*.dat` in the `creatures` directory we get an
error.

---

# For loop

Instead, we can use a **loop**
to do some operation once for each thing in a list.
Here's a simple example that displays the first three lines of each file in turn:

~~~
$ for filename in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
> do
>    head -n 3 $filename
> done
~~~


~~~
COMMON NAME: basilisk
CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris
UPDATED: 1745-05-02
COMMON NAME: unicorn
CLASSIFICATION: equus monoceros
UPDATED: 1738-11-24
~~~


When the shell sees the keyword `for`,
it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each thing `in` a list.
Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to
the **variable**, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to 
the next item in the list.
Inside the loop,
we call for the variable's value by putting `$` in front of it.
The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat
the **variable** as a variable name and substitute its value in its place,
rather than treat it as text or an external command. 

---

# For loop


In this example, the list is two filenames: `basilisk.dat` and `unicorn.dat`.
Each time the loop iterates, it will assign a file name to the variable `filename`
and run the `head` command.
The first time through the loop,
`$filename` is `basilisk.dat`. 
The interpreter runs the command `head` on `basilisk.dat`, 
and the prints the 
first three lines of `basilisk.dat`.
For the second iteration, `$filename` becomes 
`unicorn.dat`. This time, the shell runs `head` on `unicorn.dat`
and prints the first three lines of `unicorn.dat`. 
Since the list was only two items, the shell exits the `for` loop.

When using variables it is also
possible to put the names into curly braces to clearly delimit the variable
name: `$filename` is equivalent to `${filename}`, but is different from
`${file}name`. You may find this notation in other people's programs.

# Variable names

We have called the variable in this loop `filename`
in order to make its purpose clearer to human readers.
The shell itself doesn't care what the variable is called;
if we wrote this loop as:

~~~
for x in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
do
    head -n 3 $x
done
~~~


or:

~~~
for temperature in basilisk.dat unicorn.dat
do
    head -n 3 $temperature
done
~~~


it would work exactly the same way.
*Don't do this.*
Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
so meaningless names (like `x`) or misleading names (like `temperature`)
increase the odds that the program won't do what its readers think it does.

---

# For loop

Here's a slightly more complicated loop:

~~~
for filename in *.dat
do
    echo $filename
    head -n 100 $filename | tail -n 20
done
~~~


The shell starts by expanding `*.dat` to create the list of files it will process.
The **loop body**
then executes two commands for each of those files.
The first, `echo`, just prints its command-line arguments to standard output.
For example:

---

# Echo command

~~~
$ echo hello there
~~~

prints:

~~~
hello there
~~~


In this case,
since the shell expands `$filename` to be the name of a file,
`echo $filename` just prints the name of the file.
Note that we can't write this as:

~~~
for filename in *.dat
do
    $filename
    head -n 100 $filename | tail -n 20
done
~~~


because then the first time through the loop,
when `$filename` expanded to `basilisk.dat`, the shell would try to run `basilisk.dat` as a program.
Finally,
the `head` and `tail` combination selects lines 81-100
from whatever file is being processed
(assuming the file has at least 100 lines).

> {: . output}


---

Going back to our original file copying problem,
we can solve it using this loop:

~~~
for filename in *.dat
do
    cp $filename original-$filename
done
~~~


This loop runs the `cp` command once for each filename.
The first time,
when `$filename` expands to `basilisk.dat`,
the shell executes:

~~~
cp basilisk.dat original-basilisk.dat
~~~


The second time, the command is:

~~~
cp unicorn.dat original-unicorn.dat
~~~

## Nelle's Pipeline: Processing Files

Nelle is now ready to process her data files.
Since she's still learning how to use the shell,
she decides to build up the required commands in stages.
Her first step is to make sure that she can select the right files --- remember,
these are ones whose names end in 'A' or 'B', rather than 'Z'. Starting from her home directory, Nelle types:

~~~
$ cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03
$ for datafile in NENE*[AB].txt
> do
>     echo $datafile
> done
~~~


~~~
NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt
...
NENE02043A.txt
NENE02043B.txt
~~~

---

## Nelle's Pipeline: Processing Files

Her next step is to decide
what to call the files that the `goostats` analysis program will create.
Prefixing each input file's name with "stats" seems simple,
so she modifies her loop to do that:

~~~
$ for datafile in NENE*[AB].txt
> do
>     echo $datafile stats-$datafile
> done
~~~


~~~
NENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt stats-NENE01736A.txt
...
NENE02043A.txt stats-NENE02043A.txt
NENE02043B.txt stats-NENE02043B.txt
~~~


She hasn't actually run `goostats` yet,
but now she's sure she can select the right files and generate the right output filenames.

---

# Using the arrow keys

Typing in commands over and over again is becoming tedious,
though,
and Nelle is worried about making mistakes,
so instead of re-entering her loop,
she presses the up arrow.
In response,
the shell redisplays the whole loop on one line
(using semi-colons to separate the pieces):

~~~
$ for datafile in NENE*[AB].txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done
~~~


Using the left arrow key,
Nelle backs up and changes the command `echo` to `bash goostats`:

~~~
$ for datafile in NENE*[AB].txt; do bash goostats $datafile stats-$datafile; done
~~~


When she presses Enter,
the shell runs the modified command.
However, nothing appears to happen --- there is no output.
After a moment, Nelle realizes that since her script doesn't print anything to the screen any longer,
she has no idea whether it is running, much less how quickly.
She kills the running command by typing `Ctrl-C`,
uses up-arrow to repeat the command,
and edits it to read:

~~~
$ for datafile in NENE*[AB].txt; do echo $datafile; 
bash goostats $datafile stats-$datafile; done
~~~

---

> ## Beginning and End
>
> We can move to the beginning of a line in the shell by typing `Ctrl-a`
> and to the end using `Ctrl-e`.


When she runs her program now,
it produces one line of output every five seconds or so:

~~~
NENE01729A.txt
NENE01729B.txt
NENE01736A.txt
...
~~~


1518 times 5 seconds,
divided by 60,
tells her that her script will take about two hours to run.
As a final check,
she opens another terminal window,
goes into `north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03`,
and uses `cat stats-NENE01729B.txt`
to examine one of the output files.
It looks good,
so she decides to get some coffee and catch up on her reading.

> ## Those Who Know History Can Choose to Repeat It

> Another way to repeat previous work is to use the `history` command to
> get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed, and
> then to use `!123` (where "123" is replaced by the command number) to
> repeat one of those commands. For example, if Nelle types this:
>
> ~~~
> $ history | tail -n 5

> 
> ~~~
>   456  ls -l NENE0*.txt
>   457  rm stats-NENE01729B.txt.txt
>   458  bash goostats NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt
>   459  ls -l NENE0*.txt
>   460  history
> ~~~
> 
>
> then she can re-run `goostats` on `NENE01729B.txt` simply by typing
> `!458`.

> ## Other History Commands
>
> There are a number of other shortcut commands for getting at the history.
>
> - `Ctrl-R` enters a history search mode "reverse-i-search" and finds the 
> most recent command in your history that matches the text you enter next.
> Press `Ctrl-R` one or more additional times to search for earlier matches.
> - `!!` retrieves the immediately preceding command 
> (you may or may not find this more convenient than using the up-arrow)
> - `!$` retrieves the last word of the last command.
> That's useful more often than you might expect: after
> `bash goostats NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt`, you can type
> `less !$` to look at the file `stats-NENE01729B.txt`, which is
> quicker than doing up-arrow and editing the command-line.
