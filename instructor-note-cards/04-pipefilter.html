# Molecules directory

Now that we know a few basic commands,
we can finally look at the shell's most powerful feature:
the ease with which it lets us combine existing programs in new ways.
We'll start with a directory called `molecules`
that contains six files describing some simple organic molecules.
The `.pdb` extension indicates that these files are in Protein Data Bank format,
a simple text format that specifies the type and position of each atom in the molecule.

~~~
$ ls molecules
~~~


~~~
cubane.pdb    ethane.pdb    methane.pdb
octane.pdb    pentane.pdb   propane.pdb
~~~


---

# Word count command

Let's go into that directory with `cd` and run the command `wc *.pdb`.
`wc` is the "word count" command:
it counts the number of lines, words, and characters in files.
The `*` in `*.pdb` matches zero or more characters,
so the shell turns `*.pdb` into a list of all `.pdb` files in the current directory:

~~~
$ cd molecules
$ wc *.pdb
~~~


~~~
  20  156 1158 cubane.pdb
  12   84  622 ethane.pdb
   9   57  422 methane.pdb
  30  246 1828 octane.pdb
  21  165 1226 pentane.pdb
  15  111  825 propane.pdb
 107  819 6081 total
~~~

> ## Wildcards
>
> `*` is a **wildcard**. It matches zero or more
> characters, so `*.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and every
> file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches
> `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only
> matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.
>
> `?` is also a wildcard, but it only matches a single character. This
> means that `p?.pdb` would match `pi.pdb` or `p5.pdb` (if we had these two
> files in the `molecules` directory), but not `propane.pdb`.
> We can use any number of wildcards at a time: for example, `p*.p?*`
> matches anything that starts with a 'p' and ends with '.', 'p', and at
> least one more character (since the `?` has to match one character, and
> the final `*` can match any number of characters). Thus, `p*.p?*` would
> match `preferred.practice`, and even `p.pi` (since the first `*` can
> match no characters at all), but not `quality.practice` (doesn't start
> with 'p') or `preferred.p` (there isn't at least one character after the
> '.p').

> ## Wildcards
> When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a
> list of matching filenames *before* running the command that was
> asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match
> any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command
> as it is. For example typing `ls *.pdf` in the `molecules` directory
> (which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in
> an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`.
> However, generally commands like `wc` and `ls` see the lists of
> file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards
> themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with
> expanding wildcards, and this is another example of orthogonal design.

# Word count lines

If we run `wc -l` instead of just `wc`,
the output shows only the number of lines per file:

~~~
$ wc -l *.pdb
~~~


~~~
  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total
~~~


We can also use `-w` to get only the number of words,
or `-c` to get only the number of characters.

---

# Redirect Output

Which of these files is shortest?
It's an easy question to answer when there are only six files,
but what if there were 6000?
Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:

~~~
$ wc -l *.pdb > lengths.txt
~~~


The greater than symbol, `>`, tells the shell to **redirect** the command's output
to a file instead of printing it to the screen. (This is why there is no screen output:
everything that `wc` would have printed has gone into the
file `lengths.txt` instead.)  The shell will create
the file if it doesn't exist. If the file exists, it will be
silently overwritten, which may lead to data loss and thus requires
some caution.
`ls lengths.txt` confirms that the file exists:

~~~
$ ls lengths.txt
~~~


~~~
lengths.txt
~~~


---

# Concatenate command

We can now send the content of `lengths.txt` to the screen using `cat lengths.txt`.
`cat` stands for "concatenate":
it prints the contents of files one after another.
There's only one file in this case,
so `cat` just shows us what it contains:

~~~
$ cat lengths.txt
~~~


~~~
  20  cubane.pdb
  12  ethane.pdb
   9  methane.pdb
  30  octane.pdb
  21  pentane.pdb
  15  propane.pdb
 107  total
~~~


---

> ## Output Page by Page
>
> We'll continue to use `cat` in this lesson, for convenience and consistency,
> but it has the disadvantage that it always dumps the whole file onto your screen.
> More useful in practice is the command `less`,
> which you use with `$ less lengths.txt`.
> This displays a screenful of the file, and then stops.
> You can go forward one screenful by pressing the spacebar,
> or back one by pressing `b`.  Press `q` to quit.


---

# Sort command

Now let's use the `sort` command to sort its contents.
We will also use the `-n` flag to specify that the sort is
numerical instead of alphabetical.
This does *not* change the file;
instead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:

~~~
$ sort -n lengths.txt
~~~


~~~
  9  methane.pdb
 12  ethane.pdb
 15  propane.pdb
 20  cubane.pdb
 21  pentane.pdb
 30  octane.pdb
107  total
~~~


---

# Head command

We can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called `sorted-lengths.txt`
by putting `> sorted-lengths.txt` after the command,
just as we used `> lengths.txt` to put the output of `wc` into `lengths.txt`.
Once we've done that,
we can run another command called `head` to get the first few lines in `sorted-lengths.txt`:

~~~
$ sort -n lengths.txt > sorted-lengths.txt
$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt
~~~


~~~
  9  methane.pdb
~~~


Using `-n 1` with `head` tells it that
we only want the first line of the file;
`-n 20` would get the first 20,
and so on.
Since `sorted-lengths.txt` contains the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest,
the output of `head` must be the file with the fewest lines.

# Confusion of intermediate files

If you think this is confusing,
you're in good company:
even once you understand what `wc`, `sort`, and `head` do,
all those intermediate files make it hard to follow what's going on.
We can make it easier to understand by running `sort` and `head` together:

---

# Using pipes

~~~
$ sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1
~~~


~~~
  9  methane.pdb
~~~


The vertical bar, `|`, between the two commands is called a **pipe**.
It tells the shell that we want to use
the output of the command on the left
as the input to the command on the right.
The computer might create a temporary file if it needs to,
or copy data from one program to the other in memory,
or something else entirely;
we don't have to know or care.

---

# Chaining pipes

Nothing prevents us from chaining pipes consecutively.
That is, we can for example send the output of `wc` directly to `sort`,
and then the resulting output to `head`.
Thus we first use a pipe to send the output of `wc` to `sort`:

~~~
$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n
~~~


~~~
   9 methane.pdb
  12 ethane.pdb
  15 propane.pdb
  20 cubane.pdb
  21 pentane.pdb
  30 octane.pdb
 107 total
~~~


And now we send the output of this pipe, through another pipe, to `head`, so that the full pipeline becomes:

~~~
$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n | head -n 1
~~~


~~~
   9  methane.pdb
~~~


---

## Nelle's Pipeline: Checking Files

Nelle has run her samples through the assay machines
and created 17 files in the `north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03` directory described earlier.
As a quick sanity check, starting from her home directory, Nelle types:

~~~
$ cd north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03
$ wc -l *.txt
~~~


The output is 18 lines that look like this:

~~~
300 NENE01729A.txt
300 NENE01729B.txt
300 NENE01736A.txt
300 NENE01751A.txt
300 NENE01751B.txt
300 NENE01812A.txt
... ...
~~~

---

# Checking for correct number of lines

Now she types this:

~~~
$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 5
~~~

~~~
 240 NENE02018B.txt
 300 NENE01729A.txt
 300 NENE01729B.txt
 300 NENE01736A.txt
 300 NENE01751A.txt
~~~

Whoops, one of the files is 60 lines shorter than the others.
When she goes back and checks it,
she sees that she did that assay at 8:00 on a Monday morning --- someone
was probably in using the machine on the weekend,
and she forgot to reset it.
Before re-running that sample,
she checks to see if any files have too much data:

---

# Checking for correct number of lines

~~~
$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | tail -n 5
~~~


~~~
 300 NENE02040B.txt
 300 NENE02040Z.txt
 300 NENE02043A.txt
 300 NENE02043B.txt
5040 total
~~~


Those numbers look good --- but what's that 'Z' doing there in the third-to-last line?
All of her samples should be marked 'A' or 'B';
by convention,
her lab uses 'Z' to indicate samples with missing information.
To find others like it, she does this:

---

# Checking for erroneous Z files

~~~
$ ls *Z.txt
~~~


~~~
NENE01971Z.txt    NENE02040Z.txt
~~~


Sure enough,
when she checks the log on her laptop,
there's no depth recorded for either of those samples.
Since it's too late to get the information any other way,
she must exclude those two files from her analysis.
She could just delete them using `rm`,
but there are actually some analyses she might do later where depth doesn't matter,
so instead, she'll just be careful later on to select files using the wildcard expression `*[AB].txt`.
As always,
the `*` matches any number of characters;
the expression `[AB]` matches either an 'A' or a 'B',
so this matches all the valid data files she has.
