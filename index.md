The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users
have been alive. It has survived because it's a powerful tool that
allows users to perform complex and powerful tasks, often with just
a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate repetitive
tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.

Use of the shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing
tasks, including high-performance computing. These lessons will introduce
you to this powerful tool.

## Prerequisites

This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the
shell. If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize
the word "file" and either "directory" or "folder" (two common words
for the same thing), you're ready for this lesson.

If you're already comfortable manipulating files and directories,
searching for files with `grep` and `find`, and writing simple loops
and scripts, you probably want to explore the next lesson:
