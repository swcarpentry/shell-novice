## FAQ

*   *Where can I get help?*

    Mail us at [admin@software-carpentry.org](mailto:admin@software-carpentry.org),
    or join our [discussion list](http://lists.software-carpentry.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org)
    and ask for help there.

*   *Where can I report problems or suggest improvements?*

    Please
    [file an issue](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue)
    or [mail us](mailto:admin@software-carpentry.org).

*   *Why does the lesson repository have to be created from scratch? Why not fork `lesson-template` on GitHub?*

    Because any particular user can only have one fork of a repository,
    but instructors frequently need to work on several workshops at once.

*   *Why use Pandoc?  Why not some other markup language and some other converter?*

    Because it supports a richer dialect of Markdown than Jekyll
    (the converter that GitHub uses by default).
