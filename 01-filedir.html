<p>The part of the operating system responsible for managing
files and directories is called the <strong>file system</strong>.
It organizes our data into files, which hold information, and
directories (also called “folders”), which hold files or other
directories.</p>
<p>Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect,
rename, and delete files and directories. To start exploring them,
let’s open a shell window: (teach whoami first, so the PS1='S ' is more obvious)</p>
<aside class="callout panel panel-info">

<div class="panel-heading">
<h2 id="preparation-magic"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Preparation

</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>If you type the command: <code>PS1='$ '</code>
into your shell, your window should look like our example in this
lesson.<br>
This isn’t necessary to follow along (in fact, your prompt may have
other helpful information you want to know about). This is up to you!</p>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The dollar sign is a <strong>prompt</strong>,
which shows us that the shell is waiting for input; your shell may use
a different character as a prompt and may add information before the
prompt. When typing commands, either from these lessons or from other
sources, do not type the prompt, only the commands that follow it.</p>
<p>Type the command <code>whoami</code>, then press
the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the
shell. The command’s output is the ID of the current user, i.e., it
shows us who the shell thinks we are:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">whoami</span></code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>nelle</code></pre>
<p>More specifically, when we type <code>whoami</code>
the shell:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>finds a program called <code>whoami</code>,</li>
<li>runs that program,</li>
<li>displays that program’s output, then</li>
<li>displays a new prompt to tell us that it’s ready for more
commands.</li>

<h2 id="username-variation"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Username
Variation</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>In this lesson, we have used the username <code>nelle</code>
(associated with our hypothetical scientist Nelle) in example input and
output throughout.<br>
However, when you type this lesson’s commands on your computer, you
should see and use something different, namely, the username associated
with the user account on your computer. This username will be the
output from <code>whoami</code>. In what follows, <code>nelle</code>
should always be replaced by that username. Also, here's the first
example of how Windows computers can output differently. My computer
returns the computer name and my name.</p>
</div>
<p>Next, let’s find out where we are by running a command called <code>pwd</code>
(which stands for “print working directory”). At any moment, our <strong>current
working directory</strong> is our current default directory,
i.e., the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands
in unless we explicitly specify something else. Here, the computer’s
response is <code>/Users/nelle</code>, which is Nelle’s <strong>home
directory</strong>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">pwd</span></code></pre>

<h2 id="home-directory-variation"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Home
Directory Variation</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>The home directory path will look different on different
operating systems. On Linux it may look like <code>/home/nelle</code>,
and on Windows it will be similar to <code>C:\Documents and
Settings\nelle</code> or <code>C:\Users\nelle</code>.<br>
(Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of
Windows by leading with the <code>/c/</code>. Just think of <code>/c/</code> as the same as <code>/</code>.) In future
examples, we’ve used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows
output may differ slightly, but should be generally similar.</p>
</div>
<p>To understand what a “home directory” is, let’s have a look at
how the file system as a whole is organized. For the sake of example,
we’ll be illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle’s computer.
After this illustration, you’ll be learning commands to explore your
own filesystem, which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be
exactly identical.</p>
<p>On Nelle’s computer, the filesystem looks like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="01-filedir_files/filesystem.svg" alt="The File System">
<p class="caption">The File System</p>
</div>
<p>At the top is the <strong>root directory</strong>
that holds everything else. We refer to it using a slash character <code>/</code>
on its own; this is the leading slash in <code>/Users/nelle</code>.</p>
<p>Inside that directory are several other directories: <code>bin</code>
(which is where some built-in programs are stored), <code>data</code>
(for miscellaneous data files), <code>Users</code> (where
users’ personal directories are located), <code>tmp</code>
(for temporary files that don’t need to be stored long-term), and so on.</p>
<p>We know that our current working directory <code>/Users/nelle</code>
is stored inside <code>/Users</code> because <code>/Users</code>
is the first part of its name. Similarly, we know that <code>/Users</code>
is stored inside the root directory <code>/</code> because
its name begins with <code>/</code>.</p>
<aside class="callout panel panel-info">
</aside>
<div class="panel-heading">
<h2 id="slashes"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Slashes</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>Notice that there are two meanings for the <code>/</code>
character. When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it
refers to the root directory. When it appears <em>inside</em>
a name, it’s just a separator.</p>
</div>
<p>Underneath <code>/Users</code>, we find one
directory for each user with an account on Nelle’s machine, her
colleagues the Mummy and Wolfman.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="01-filedir_files/home-directories.svg" alt="Home Directories">
<p class="caption">Home Directories</p>
</div>
<p>I've tried to bring a small example to this presentation since I
don't have a whiteboard. (cat Filesystem). The Mummy’s files are stored
in <code>/Users/imhotep</code>,
Wolfman’s in <code>/Users/larry</code>, and Nelle’s in <code>/Users/nelle</code>.
Because Nelle is the user in our examples here, this is why we get <code>/Users/nelle</code>
as our home directory.<br>
Typically, when you open a new command prompt you will be in your home
directory to start.</p>
<p>Now let’s learn the command that will let us see the contents
of our own filesystem. We can see what’s in our home directory by
running <code>ls</code>, which stands for “listing”:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span></code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>Applications Documents Library Music Public<br>Desktop Downloads Movies Pictures</code></pre>
<p>(Again, your results may be slightly different depending on
your operating system and how you have customized your filesystem.)</p>
<p><code>ls</code> prints the names of the files and
directories in the current directory in alphabetical order, arranged
neatly into columns. We can make its output more comprehensible by
using the <strong>flag</strong> <code>-F</code>,
which tells <code>ls</code> to add a trailing <code>/</code>
to the names of directories:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F</code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>Applications/ Documents/ Library/ Music/ Public/<br>Desktop/ Downloads/ Movies/ Pictures/</code></pre>
<p>Here, we can see that our home directory contains mostly <strong>sub-directories</strong>.
Any names in your output that don’t have trailing slashes, are plain
old <strong>files</strong>. And note that there is a space
between <code>ls</code> and <code>-F</code>:
without it, the shell thinks we’re trying to run a command called <code>ls-F</code>,
which doesn’t exist. Windows sometimes adds an asterisk after a file, but you can ignore that for now.</p>
<aside class="callout panel panel-info">

<div class="panel-heading">
<h2 id="parameters-vs.arguments"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Parameters
vs.&nbsp;Arguments</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_%28computer_programming%29#Parameters_and_arguments">Wikipedia</a>,
the terms argument and <strong>parameter</strong> mean
slightly different things. In practice, however, most people use them
interchangeably or inconsistently, so we will too.</p>
</div>
<p>We can also use <code>ls</code> to see the
contents of a different directory. Let’s take a look at our <code>Desktop</code>
directory by running <code>ls -F Desktop</code>, i.e., the
command <code>ls</code> with the <strong>arguments</strong>
<code>-F</code> and <code>Desktop</code>. The
second argument — the one <em>without</em> a leading dash
— tells <code>ls</code> that we want a listing of
something other than our current working directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F Desktop</code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>data-shell/</code></pre>
<p>Your output should be a list of all the files and
sub-directories on your Desktop, including the <code>data-shell</code>
directory you downloaded at the start of the lesson. Take a look at
your Desktop to confirm that your output is accurate. Mine is cleaned up for this presentation</p>
<p>As you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent
on the idea that your <span style="font-weight: bold;">files are organized in an hierarchical file
system</span>.<br>
Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our
work: it’s possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,
just as it’s possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,
but it’s a self-defeating strategy.</p>
<p>Now that we know the <code>data-shell</code>
directory is located on our Desktop, we can do two things.</p>
<p>First, we can look at its contents, using the same strategy as
before, passing a directory name to <code>ls</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F Desktop/data-shell</code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>creatures/ molecules/ notes.txt solar.pdf<br>data/ north-pacific-gyre/ pizza.cfg writing/</code></pre>
<p>Second, we can actually change our location to a different
directory, so we are no longer located in our home directory.</p>
<p>The command to change locations is <code>cd</code>
followed by a directory name to change our working directory. <code>cd</code>
stands for “change directory”, which is a bit misleading: the command
doesn’t change the directory, it changes the shell’s idea of what
directory we are in. <span style="font-weight: bold;">We move around in our directory</span></p>
<p>Let’s say we want to move to the <code>data</code>
directory we saw above. We can use the following series of commands to
get there:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cd</span> Desktop<br>$ <span class="kw">cd</span> data-shell<br>$ <span class="kw">cd</span> data</code></pre>
</div>
<p>These commands will move us from our home directory onto our
Desktop, then into the <code>data-shell</code> directory,
then into the <code>data</code> directory. <code>cd</code>
doesn’t print anything, but if we run <code>pwd</code>
after it, we can see that we are now in <code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data</code>.
If we run <code>ls</code> without arguments now, it lists
the contents of <code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data</code>,
because that’s where we now are:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">pwd</span></code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F</code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>amino-acids.txt elements/ pdb/ salmon.txt<br>animals.txt morse.txt planets.txt sunspot.txt</code></pre>
<p>We now know how to go down the directory tree: how do we go
up? We might try the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">cd</span> data-shell</code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="error"><code>-bash: cd: data-shell: No such file or directory</code></pre>
<p>But we get an error! Why is this?</p>
<p>With our methods so far, <code>cd</code> can only
see sub-directories inside your current directory. <span style="font-weight: bold;">BUT,</span> There are different
ways to see directories above your current location; <span style="font-weight: bold;">AND</span> we’ll start with
the simplest.</p>
<p>There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory
level that looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cd</span> ..</code></pre>
</div>
<p><code>..</code> is a special directory name
meaning “the directory containing this one”, or more succinctly, the <strong>parent</strong>
of the current directory. Sure enough, if we run <code>pwd</code>
after running <code>cd ..</code>, we’re back in <code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">pwd</span></code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell</code></pre>
<p>The special directory <code>..</code> doesn’t
usually show up when we run <code>ls</code>. If we want to
display it, we can give <code>ls</code> the <code>-a</code>
flag:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> -F -a</code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>./ creatures/ notes.txt<br>../ data/ pizza.cfg<br>.bash_profile molecules/ solar.pdf<br>Desktop/ north-pacific-gyre/ writing/</code></pre>
<p><code>-a</code> stands for “show all”; it forces <code>ls</code>
to show us file and directory names that begin with <code>.</code>,
such as <code>..</code> (<small><small><small>which, if we’re in <code>/Users/nelle</code>,
refers to the <code>/Users</code> directory</small></small></small>) As you can
see, it also displays another special directory that’s just called <code>.</code>,
which means “the current working directory”. It may seem redundant to
have a name for it, but we’ll see some uses for it soon.</p>

<p>In addition to the hidden directories <code>..</code>
and <code>.</code>, you’ll also see a file called <code>.bash_profile</code>.
This file usually contains settings to customize the shell. There may
also be similar files called <code>.bashrc</code> or <code>.bash_login</code>
in your own home directory. The <code>.</code> prefix is
used to prevent these configuration files from cluttering the terminal
when a standard <code>ls</code> command is used. Most of time you don't need to change these files anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the hidden directories <code>..</code> and <code>.</code>, you may also see a file called <code>.bash_profile</code>. This file usually contains shell configuration settings. You may also see other files and directories beginning with <code>.</code>. These are usually files and directories that are used to configure different programs on your computer. The prefix <code>.</code> is used to prevent these configuration files from cluttering the terminal when a standard <code>ls</code> command is used.</p>

<h2 id="orthogonality"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span>Orthogonality</h2>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>So now we've seen special names <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>
don’t belong to <code>ls but also cd</code>; they are interpreted the
same way by every program. For example, if we are in <code>/Users/nelle/data</code>,
the command <code>ls ..</code> will give us a listing of <code>/Users/nelle</code>.
When the meanings of the parts are the same no matter how they’re
combined, programmers say they are <strong>orthogonal</strong>:
Orthogonal systems tend to be easier for people to learn because there
are fewer special cases and exceptions to keep track of.</p>
</div>
<p>These then, are the basic commands for navigating the
filesystem on your computer: <code>pwd</code>, <code>ls</code>
and <code>cd</code>. Let’s explore some variations on
those commands. What happens if you type <code>cd</code>
on its own, without giving a directory?</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cd</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>How can you check what happened? <code>pwd</code>
gives us the answer!</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">pwd</span></code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>/Users/nelle</code></pre>
<<<<<<< HEAD
<p>It turns out that <code>cd</code> without an
argument will <span style="font-weight: bold;">ALWAYS</span> return you to your home directory, which is great if
you’ve gotten lost in your own filesystem.</p>
<p>Let’s try returning to the <code>data</code>
directory from before. Last time, we used three commands, but we can
actually string together the list of directories to move to <code>data</code>
in one step:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">cd</span> Desktop/data-shell/data</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Check that we’ve moved to the right place by running <code>pwd</code>
and <code>ls -F</code>.</p>
<p>If we want to move up one level from the shell directory, we
could use <code>cd ..</code>. But there is another way to
move to any directory, regardless of your current location.</p>
<p>So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory
path (as above), we have been using <strong>relative paths</strong>.
When you use a relative path with a command like <code>ls</code>
or <code>cd</code>, it tries to find that location from
where we are, rather than from the root of the file system.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to specify the <strong>absolute
path</strong> to a directory by including its entire path from
the root directory, which is indicated by a leading slash. The leading <code>/</code>
tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the file system,
so it always refers to exactly one directory, no matter where we are
when we run the command.</p>
<p>This allows us to move to our data-shell directory from
anywhere on the filesystem (including from inside <code>data</code>).
To find the absolute path we’re looking for, we can use <code>pwd</code>
and then extract the piece we need to move to <code>data-shell</code>.</p>

<p>Knowing just this much about files and directories, Nelle is
ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
First, she creates a directory called <code>north-pacific-gyre</code>

a directory called <code>2012-07-03</code>, which is the
date she started processing the samples. She used to use names like <code>conference-paper</code>

use it as part of each data file’s name. Since the assay machine’s
output is plain text, she will call her files <code>NENE01729A.txt</code>,
<code>NENE01812A.txt</code>, and so on. All 1520 files will
go into the same directory.</p>
<p>If she is in her home directory, Nelle can see what files she
has using the command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This is a lot to type, but she can let the shell do most of
the work through what is called <strong>tab completion</strong>.
If she types:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> nor</code></pre>
</div>
<p>and then presses tab (the tab key on her keyboard), the shell
automatically completes the directory name for her:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">ls</span> north-pacific-gyre/</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If she presses tab again, Bash will add <code>2012-07-03/</code>
to the command, since it’s the only possible completion. Pressing tab
again does nothing, since there are 19 possibilities; pressing tab
twice brings up a list of all the files, and so on. This is called <strong>tab
completion</strong>, and we will see it in many other tools as we
go on.</p>
