Software Carpentry is an open source project,
and we welcome contributions of all kinds:
new lessons,
fixes to existing material,
bug reports,
and reviews of proposed changes are all equally welcome.

By contributing,
you are agreeing that Software Carpentry may redistribute your work under
[these licenses][license].
You also agree to abide by our
[contributor code of conduct][conduct].

## Getting Started

1.  We use GitHub flow to manage changes,
    which is explained in the chapter [Contributing to a Project][pro-git-chapter]
    in Scott Chacon's book *Pro Git*.

2.  For our lessons,
    you should branch from and submit pull requests against the `gh-pages` branch.

3.  When editing lessons, please only commit changes to the Markdown
    files, *not* the generated HTML.  We will re-create the HTML after
    your pull request is merged.  (Working this way ensures that each
    change only needs to be reviewed once, in one place.)

4.  If you're looking for things to work on,
    please see [the list of issues for this repository][issues],
    or for [our other lessons][swc-lessons].
    Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are equally welcome.

5.  The maintainers for this repository are [Christina Koch][christina] and [Gabriel Devenyi][gabriel].
    Feel free to contact them if you have any questions or languishing pull requests.  

## Other Resources

1.  This lesson is based on the template found at
    [https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template).
    That repository has instructions on formatting and previewing lessons.

2.  For a list of helpful commands run `make` in this directory.
