##Contributing to this repository

Welcome!  Thanks for your interest in contributing to Software Carpentry's introductory shell lesson.  

###Intro

Software Carpentry is an open source project, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: new and improved lessons, bug reports, and small fixes to existing material are all useful.

By contributing, you are agreeing that Software Carpentry may redistribute your work under these licenses.

###Making and Submitting Changes

Don't know where to start?  Please see the current list of issues (linked in the right sidebar) for ideas for contributing to this repository. 

For making your contribution, we use the GitHub flow, which is nicely explained in the chapter [Contributing to a Project in Pro Git by Scott Chacon](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project).  For this repository, you should branch from and then submit a pull request against the `gh-pages` branch instead of `master`.  

When editing lesson pages, you need only change and commit the `.md` source file.  

Even if you don't have any changes to make, we welcome comments on  pull requests, or discussion among issues.  

##Other Resources

This lesson is based on the template found at  https://github.com/swcarpentry/lesson-template.  Visit that repository for instructions on formatting, building, and submitting Software Carpentry lessons, or run make in this directory for a list of helpful commands.
